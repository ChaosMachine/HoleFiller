## Paste excel data to Planck system!
Simply paste excel data e.g.:
![image](https://github.com/ChaosMachine/HoleFiller/assets/33417875/a21dac8f-4db8-49d5-ae77-5aa08ba87f2c)
into the box and send it to Planck

Planck is unable to change these data (throws 500) so you have to make all changes in this system. 
Supports Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc and google sheets. 

This was made using code from Planck and StackOverflow.
